# MovieLens Recommender System

An educational and detailed project to showcase my understanding and proficiency of [the R programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)), [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and the topics at hand: [data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) (manipulation, exploration, visualization...) and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) (linear and matrix factorization models in particular).

The project is made out of the following files:

* The [R Markdown file](./MovieLens-Recommender-System.Rmd) which documents and details to considerable length the processes and intricacies of building a recommender system.

* The [R script](./MovieLens-Recommender-System.R) which contains all the code within the R Markdown file.

* An [HTML file](./MovieLens-Recommender-System.html) knitted by the R Markdown file. It has been [uplodad to RPubs](https://rpubs.com/outerelocarlos/MovieLens-Recommender-System) where it can be properly visualized.

* A [PDF report](./MovieLens-Recommender-System.pdf) knitted by the R Markdown file.
